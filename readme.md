extra things added:
- centralised nav list when page width is less than 500px
- made results box empty every time the button is clicked
- added way to prevent duplicate form entries

YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A TRY & CATCH THING. in other words, add a error handler if connecting to the server or making a query fails.

ADD a way to prevent duplicate form entries (e.g License Number already exists) in "add-vehicle.js"
